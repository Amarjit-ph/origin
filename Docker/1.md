# Docker Compose - Multi docker container

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications

Docker Compose is used to run multiple containers as a single service. For example, suppose you had an application which required NGNIX and MySQL, you could create one file which would start both the containers as a service without the need to start each one separately.

`Two seperate containers wrap into one container`

Containers in same container can talk internally without any connection
