MongoDB

Humongous - Because it can store a lots of Data

Database > Collection s > Documents
Schemaless - Don't need to have same structure


```
NOSQL = Database > Collections > Documents [ No Relation between collections ]
```
## NoSQL
Schema-less
No/Few relations
Data is typically merged in few collections
Both horizontal and vertical scaling is possible
Great performance for mass read & write requests



JSON(BSON) Data Format
```
{    
    "name":"Max",
    "age":29,
    "address":{
        "city":"Munich"
    },
    "hobbies": [
        {"name":"Cooking"},
    ]

}
```
