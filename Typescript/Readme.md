# Typescript
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

- **JavaScript and More** - TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.
- **A Result You Can Trust** - TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.
- **Safety at Scale** - TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.
